## Basics
Kotlin is very similar to other languages when it comes to the basics like operators, lists, and loops, but there are some important differences.

The following features may be different in Kotlin than what you're used to in other languages:

Kotlin types can't be implicitly convertedâ€”use casting.
Variables declared with val can only be assigned once.
Kotlin variables are not nullable by default. Use ? to make variables nullable.
With Kotlin, you can loop through the index and elements of an array at the same time in a for loop.
The following Kotlin programming constructs are similar to those in other languages:

Arrays and lists can have a single type or mixed types.
Arrays and lists can be nested.
You can create loops with for, while, do/while, and repeat.
The when statement is Kotlin's version of the switch statement, but when is more flexible.

## Functions


## Classes and objects
- Under the hood, Kotlin automatically creates getters and setters for the properties you defined in the Aquarium class,but you can also define your own getters and setters.

- Kotlin classes can have primary and secondary constructors. The primary constructor is part of the class header. Secondary constructors are defined inside the class body.

- In Kotlin, classes, objects, interfaces, constructors, functions, properties, and their setters can have visibility modifiers:
   - public means visible outside the class. Everything is public by default, including variables and methods of the class.
   - internal means it will only be visible within that module. A module is a set of Kotlin files compiled together, for example, a library or application.
   - private means it will only be visible in that class (or source file if you are working with functions).
   - protected is the same as private, but it will also be visible to any subclasses.
- Member variables :
Properties within a class, or member variables, are public by default. If you define them with var, they are mutable, that is, readable and writable. If you define them with val, they are read-only after initialization.
If you want a property that your code can read or write, but outside code can only read, you can leave the property and its getter as public and declare the setter private, as shown below.
- Inheritance and subclasses :
In Kotlin, by default, classes cannot be subclassed. Similarly, properties and member variables cannot be overridden by subclasses (though they can be accessed).
You must mark a class as open to allow it to be subclassed. Similarly, you must mark properties and member variables as open, in order to override them in the subclass. The open keyword is required, to prevent accidentally leaking implementation details as part of the class's interface.
Note: Subclasses must declare their constructor parameters explicitly.
